üìà Project Workflow
This project follows a robust, end-to-end data-to-insights workflow, using real or simulated marketing campaign datasets. The codebase is fully modular and reproducible for Jupyter/Kaggle notebooks, and extensible to dashboarding tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Plotly Dash.

### 1. Data Collection

- Import campaign data from Kaggle, CSV, or simulate synthetic marketing datasets.
- _Advanced:_ Optionally scrape live data from APIs (Google Ads, Facebook Ads).

### 2. Data Cleaning

- Handle missing values (e.g., missing revenue or impressions).
- Standardize categorical data (e.g., unify ‚ÄúSocial Media‚Äù, ‚Äúsocial_media‚Äù).
- Normalize date formats and calculate campaign durations.
- Encode categorical features for analysis.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key questions explored:

- **Which channel delivers highest ROI?**
- **Which audience segments convert best?**
- **Optimal campaign duration for max conversion?**
- **Spend vs. conversions: Is there diminishing returns?**
- **Which campaigns failed despite high spend?**

#### üìä Visualizations

- Spend vs Revenue (scatter plot)
- ROI by Channel (bar chart)
- Conversion Rate by Demographics (heatmap)
- Campaign Trends Over Time (line chart)

### 4. KPI Calculation

Essential marketing metrics calculated:

| KPI Name           | Formula                                           |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Conversion Rate    | Conversions √∑ Clicks √ó 100                       |
| Click-Through Rate (CTR)   | Clicks √∑ Impressions √ó 100              |
| Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) | Cost √∑ Conversions                 |
| Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI) | (Revenue ‚Äì Cost) √∑ Cost √ó 100|
| Lifetime Value (LTV)   | Calculated if customer data provided         |

KPIs are computed for each campaign/channel, empowering result-driven decisions.

### 5. Statistical Analysis

- **A/B Testing:** Compare campaign groups (email vs social, A vs B).
- **Chi-square Test:** Discover if demographics influence conversions.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Explore relationships between spend and conversion rate.

---

### 6. Visualization / Dashboard

Integrated dashboard highlights:

- **Overall Campaign Performance:** Spend, revenue, ROI
- **Channel Effectiveness:** Email vs Social Media vs Paid Ads
- **Demographics Analysis:** Age, Gender, Location impact
- **Campaign Trends Over Time**
- **Best & Worst Performing Campaigns**

Dashboards can be created using Tableau, Power BI, or programmatically with Plotly Dash.

### 7. Insights & Recommendations

#### Example Insights

- Social Media campaigns gave the highest ROI (120%), while TV ads had negative ROI (-20%).
- Younger customers (18‚Äì25) clicked ads more, but 30‚Äì40 age group converted more.
- Email campaigns were cost-effective but less engaging than social ads.
- Campaigns longer than 15 days showed diminishing returns.

#### Recommendations

- Reduce TV ad spending, reallocate budget to social campaigns.
- Target 30‚Äì40 age group for premium products.
- Shorten campaign durations to optimize cost vs conversion.
